          PlinDoor digitally augments a conventional room door to facilitate
          communication between people at both sides. Users can control
          PlinDoor's openness and express their moods by folding, cutting, and
          making virtual holes as they do with real paper.<br /><br />Conventional
          doors connect or separate inside and outside, but they have a major
          limitation of combining various functions on a linear scale (e.g.,
          opening degree), hindering expression of mood and communication
          intent. PlinDoor aims to grant people the freedom to express without
          compromising other door functions. To promote user expression, we
          employed virtual paper as an interaction metaphor.

          We developed PlinDoor through three stages of iterative design
          process. First, we conducted a participatory design session to observe
          how participants express their moods and communication intent with
          door-sized real paper. Second, we developed a low-fidelity prototype,
          which consists of two smartphones (as wide-angle cameras) attached on
          the both sides of the door, and two beam projectors showing video
          streams composed with a variety of door designs inspired by the
          participatory design session.<br /><br />Finally, we tested the entire
          usage scenario with participants, and improved the usability. For
          instance, while there are situations suitable for manually creating
          new door designs from scratch, in other cases participants preferred
          to recall previously-used designs or recommended by the system.
