          Jasmine is an innovative in-car HMI project aimed at establishing
          trust between drivers and level 3 autonomous vehicles. We created
          rearview-mirror accessories with natural movements and sound cues,
          allowing drivers to notice changes in handover probability.<br /><br />As
          semi-autonomous vehicles can't always maintain control, our goal is to
          alert drivers about shifts in handover likelihood, enhancing their
          awareness. Through realistic movements and friendly voices, our
          designs help drivers comprehend upcoming situations.<br /><br />The
          Jasmine project is a two-month collaboration between ID KAIST
          (Department of Industrial Design, KAIST) and IIS (Institute of
          Industrial Science, the University of Tokyo).

          Among the myriad options within the realm of in-car HMI, we embarked
          on an exploration of tangible enhancements suspended from the rearview
          mirror. Initially, these accessories lacked auditory capabilities;
          however, user testing illuminated a distinct preference among drivers
          for them to audibly communicate specific information about alterations
          in handover likelihood.<br /><br />Following a series of swift
          iterations featuring diverse concepts, a consensus was reached to
          integrate organic motions that allow drivers to instinctively
          comprehend the notifications. Ultimately, the design crystallized into
          the form of lips and a trumpet, evoking an appearance suggestive of
          sound emission.
