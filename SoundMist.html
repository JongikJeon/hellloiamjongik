          SoundMist provides users with immersive auditory experiences in a
          spatial context through a novel interaction of spraying sound into the
          surrounding space. By locating sound in space through sprayed liquid,
          users experience a blend of different sounds, each generated by
          distinct liquids. The volume changes as users move closer or farther
          away, and the sound gradually disperses over time, resembling a fading
          fragrance.<br /><br />With technology's progress, we can imagine a
          future where people could embrace multi-sensory experiences and
          innovative sound interactions. Inspired by scent diffusion's influence
          on ambiance, I designed SoundMist to blend auditory experience and
          spatial awareness, gently dispersing sound for a three-dimensional
          experience.<br /><br />SoundMist has been accepted at ACM UIST(User

          Traditionally, dispersing something is linked to tangible materials
          like liquids or gases, but I foresaw that exploring this as a sound
          interaction could lead to entirely novel experiences. Furthermore,
          this interaction could expand into spatial perception, intertwining
          with the creation of the acoustic ambiance in the surroundings. User
          testing with the prototype provided further validation for these
          findings.<br /><br />SoundMist comprises a spray prototype, an Android
          mobile app, and a Bluetooth headphone, all connected wirelessly to a
          server computer. Users interact with the spray prototype to transmit
          real-time sound identity information, while carrying the mobile app to
          share their location with the server. With information, the server
          calculates and delivers the sound to user's headphone, enabling an
          immersive auditory experience. The whole system is implemented with
          Python and Arduino.
